Sometimes, we write a story for an image, and we want to get feedback from friends or even strangers who had ever been to the same place, but it’s hard to fulfill that by the nowadays applications. So we build the app-Ka.sza that people can write down a story and upload a photo to the server, and then it will show you the stories that others write down in the same place with the same scene, after the server gets the user’s GPS information and recognize the image from the database. Ka.Sza, originating from the sound of taking photo, also means sharing story easily." alt="" /></a></div>
